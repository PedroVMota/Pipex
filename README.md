# Introduction

Pipex is a project developed as part of the 42 curriculum, focusing on the concept of pipelines in Unix-like operating systems. The goal is to implement a simplified version of the | shell operator, allowing the execution of two commands in sequence with output from the first command serving as input to the second.

## Objective

The main objectives of the Pipex project are as follows:

1. **Understand the concept of pipelines:** Gain a deep understanding of how pipelines work in Unix-like operating systems, allowing for the seamless flow of data between commands.

2. **Implement a basic shell command:** Develop a simplified version of the shell command using the `|` operator, enabling the sequential execution of two commands with the output of the first command serving as input to the second.

3. **File redirection and process execution proficiency:** Learn and demonstrate proficiency in file redirection, allowing the reading from and writing to specified files, and in process execution using system calls such as `execve`.

By achieving these objectives, the project aims to provide a hands-on experience with fundamental Unix concepts and system programming, enhancing the participant's skills in command-line operations and process management.
